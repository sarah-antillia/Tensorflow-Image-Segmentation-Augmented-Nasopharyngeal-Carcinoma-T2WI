Description
This dataset presents a collection of MRI scans from 277 patients diagnosed with primary Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC), accompanied by radiologists' annotated segmentations. Each scan includes T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted axial slices, providing detailed insights into tumor morphology. The annotations precisely delineate gross tumor volume and boundaries. The contemporary clinical and laboratory diagnoses with follow-up survival are contained in the dataset.

Collected with ethical approval, all data is anonymized to ensure privacy and confidentiality. For questions please contact Yin Li.
